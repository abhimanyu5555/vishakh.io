                                            <p>
                                                Since beginning of my Bachelors (Computer Science) in college days, I fell in love with world of Embedded and Robotics.Since then learning the nuts and bolts of both software and hardware that goes into making a System and Product. After working for 5+ years in RnD, I decided to explore new frontiers and currently pursuing Masters in Robotics at "IIIT", with area of focus being Autonomous Navigation of quadcopters using Computer Vision, Machine Learning and Trajectory Planning & Control
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                Professionally I've 5+ years of prior experience in RnD in Embedded systems and Robotics. Extensive experience in software development including firmware, boot loaders, linux kernel, Android OS, Robotics System Software. Hardware knowledge includes PCB designing and manufacturing, including basic knowledge of VHDL & VLSI
                                            </p>
                                            <p>
                                                In a nutshell what I bring to the table is, System level solution development and deployment experience in embedded and robotics system with zeal, determination and out of box thinking to develop new solution for challenging problems.

                                                            Recently, quadcopters with their advance sensors and imaging capabilities have become an imperative part of the precision agriculture. In this work, we have described a framework which performs plantation monitoring and yield estimation using the supervised learning approach, while autonomously navigating through an inter-row path of the plantation. The proposed navigation framework assists the quadcopter to follow a sequence of collision-free G P S way points and has been integrated with ROS (Robot Operating System). The trajectory planning and control module of the navigation framework employ convex programming techniques to generate minimum time trajectory between way-points and produces appropriate control inputs for the quadcopter. A new â€˜pomegranate datasetâ€™ comprising of plantation surveillance video and annotated frames capturing the varied stages of pomegranate growth along with the navigation framework are being delivered as a part of this work.

                                                            Overtaking of a vehicle moving on structured roads is one of the most frequent driving behavior. In this work, we have described a Real Time Control System based framework for overtaking maneuver of autonomous vehicles. Proposed framework incorporates Intelligent Planning and Modular control modules. Intelligent Planning module of the framework enables the vehicle to intelligently select the most appropriate behavioral characteristics given the perceived op- erating environment. Subsequently, Modular control module reduces the search space of overtaking trajectories through an SVM based learning approach. These trajectories are then examined for possible future time collision using Velocity Obstacle. It employs non linear time scaling that provides for continuous trajectories in the space of linear and angular velocities to achieve continuous curvature overtaking maneu- vers respecting velocity and acceleration bounds. Further time scaling also can scale velocities to avoid collisions and can compute a time optimal trajectory for the learned behavior. The preliminary results show the appropriateness of our proposed framework in virtual urban environment.

                                                            Autonomous navigation of generic monocular quadcopter in the natural environment requires sophisticated mechanism for perception, planning and control. In this work, we have described a framework which performs perception using monocular camera and generates minimum time collision free trajectory and control for any commercial quadcopter flying through cluttered unknown environment. The proposed framework first utilizes supervised learning approach to es- timate the dense depth map for video stream obtained from frontal monocular camera. This depth map is initially trans- formed into Ego Dynamic Space and subsequently, is used for computing locally traversable way-points utilizing binary integer programming methodology. Finally, trajectory planning and control module employs a convex programming technique to generate collision-free trajectory which follows these way- points and produces appropriate control inputs for the quad- copter. These control inputs are computed from the generated trajectory in each update. Hence, they are applicable to achieve closed-loop control similar to model predictive controller. We have demonstrated the applicability of our system in controlled indoors and in unstructured natural outdoors environment.

                                                            The challenges in generating minimum time tra-jectory and control for generic quadrocopter flying through sophisticated and unknown environment are explored in this paper. The proposed method uses convex programming tech- nique to optimize polynomial splines, which are numerically stable for high-order including large number of segments and easily formulated for efficient computation. Moreover, exploiting the differential flatness of system, these polynomial trajectories encode the dynamics and constraints of the vehicle and decouple them from trajectory planning. The framework is fast enough to be performed in real time and results in solution which is close to time optimal. As control inputs are computed from the generated trajectory in each update, they are applicable to achieve closed-loop control similar to model predictive controller.

                                                    I have known Mr. Vishakh Duggal since my Sophomore year as an Undergraduate Student Researcher at IIIT Hyderabad. He has been an outstanding source of inspiration to me. Not only has he motivated me to pursue Research with much vigor, but he also made me understand the importance of being self-driven. He is what I would call an "Opportunity Creator". He opened channels of collaboration with Hiroshima University and IIIT Hyderabad as an attempt to bridge the gap between two fields of research and creating exciting cross-domain research options for the upcoming Researchers at RRC (<a href="http://robotics.iiit.ac.in">Robotics Reseach Centre</a>). Not many people in India, being Computer Science Graduates explore the world of Electronics, much less likely, Robotics. Every move he has made in his career has had a purpose of acquiring knowledge - This sets him apart from any person I have known. Apart from being a great mentor, he has been a warm friend. The long chats we had about Robotics all over the world and life in general will always be remembered. I wish him well on his journeys further.

His curiousity and his affinity towards learning makes him stand apart. We both have collabrated  over many research projects some of which have eventually turned into publications in prestigious conferences. Throughout my association with Vishakh, I found him extremely hard working and diligent. He is a patient listener and an innovative thinker in the group.

                                                    Vishakh Duggal is one of the few people I know who is proficient in both robotics related software and hardware. His research focuses on practical robotic solutions for existing problems like precision agriculture and autonomous driving.  His experience in product development during his industrial career has frequently placed him in an ideal position to judge next-generation technology and work accordingly. Something shown in his publication record. This expert insight is backed by a routinely updated skill set covering the state-of-the-art in  optimization, machine learning, control theory, software design and modern computer architecture. Such a level of skill in both the theoretical and practical comes only with sustained dedicated effort and a passion for his field.

                                                    <p>In September 2008, an Open Source software platform primarily for smart mobile phones called Android was launched by the Open Handset alliance led by Google. Android is a complete embedded software stack, comprising of a modified Linux based kernel, middleware, application framework and applications. To run Android on their platform, Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) need to make hardware specific changes such as adding the Bootloader and writing kernel drivers for their devices and interfacing the Android stack with hardware platform drivers. STMicro took a strategic decision to move Android from Mobile platform to other Consumer Electric platforms such as SetTop Box and Digital TV.</p>

                                                        System upgrade is a tedious task which requires from formatting flash partitions, downloading new image to burning new image into the new system. Mostly in embedded world JTAG is prominently used for accessing ,configuring and formatting the system flash.

Keyboard commands from user space are transferred to keyboard kernel driver. The kernel driver then emulates corresponding keyboard key press events, allowing Android to respond to IR remote.

Frame pixels were then divided into pixels consisting user or background. Pixels comprising of background were replaced with pixels from the image of Switzerland. This project introduced me to the world of computer vision and image processing.

                                                        <p>Recently, quadcopters with their advance sensors and imaging capabilities have become an imperative part of the precision agriculture. In this work, we have described a framework which performs plantation monitoring and yield estimation using the supervised learning approach, while autonomously navigating through an inter-row path of the plantation. The proposed navigation framework assists the quadcopter to follow a sequence of collision-free G P S way points and has been integrated with ROS (Robot Operating System). The trajectory planning and control module of the navigation framework employ convex programming techniques to generate minimum time trajectory between way-points and produces appropriate control inputs for the quadcopter. A new 'pomegranate dataset' comprising of plantation surveillance video and annotated frames capturing the varied stages of pomegranate growth along with the navigation framework are being delivered as a part of this work.</p>

                                                        <h4>Abstract</h4>
                                                        <p>Overtaking of a vehicle moving on structured roads is one of the most frequent driving behavior. In this work, we have described a Real Time Control System based framework for overtaking maneuver of autonomous vehicles. Proposed framework incorporates Intelligent Planning and Modular control modules. Intelligent Planning module of the framework enables the vehicle to intelligently select the most appropriate behavioral characteristics given the perceived op- erating environment. Subsequently, Modular control module reduces the search space of overtaking trajectories through an SVM based learning approach. These trajectories are then examined for possible future time collision using Velocity Obstacle. It employs non linear time scaling that provides for continuous trajectories in the space of linear and angular velocities to achieve continuous curvature overtaking maneu- vers respecting velocity and acceleration bounds. Further time scaling also can scale velocities to avoid collisions and can compute a time optimal trajectory for the learned behavior. The preliminary results show the appropriateness of our proposed framework in virtual urban environment.</p>

                                                        <p>Autonomous navigation of generic monocular quadcopter in the natural environment requires sophisticated mechanism for perception, planning and control. In this work, we have described a framework which performs perception using monocular camera and generates minimum time collision free trajectory and control for any commercial quadcopter flying through cluttered unknown environment. The proposed framework first utilizes supervised learning approach to es- timate the dense depth map for video stream obtained from frontal monocular camera. This depth map is initially trans- formed into Ego Dynamic Space and subsequently, is used for computing locally traversable way-points utilizing binary integer programming methodology. Finally, trajectory planning and control module employs a convex programming technique to generate collision-free trajectory which follows these way- points and produces appropriate control inputs for the quad- copter. These control inputs are computed from the generated trajectory in each update. Hence, they are applicable to achieve closed-loop control similar to model predictive controller. We have demonstrated the applicability of our system in controlled indoors and in unstructured natural outdoors environment.</p>

                                                        <p>The challenges in generating minimum time trajectory and control for generic quadrocopter flying through sophisticated and unknown environment are explored in this paper. The proposed method uses convex programming tech- nique to optimize polynomial splines, which are numerically stable for high-order including large number of segments and easily formulated for efficient computation. Moreover, exploiting the differential flatness of system, these polynomial trajectories encode the dynamics and constraints of the vehicle and decouple them from trajectory planning. The framework is fast enough to be performed in real time and results in solution which is close to time optimal. As control inputs are computed from the generated trajectory in each update, they are applicable to achieve closed-loop control similar to model predictive controller.</p>
